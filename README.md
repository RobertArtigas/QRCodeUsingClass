# QRCodeUsingClass

This project originaly stems from work done by Roberto Renz and others as a wrapper for the QRCoder .Net Wrapper.

We are currently redeveloping the wrapper to support more of the features available in QRCoder.

## Help Us

We hope that other clarion developers will contribute to the project and we will be accepting pull requests.

## Requirements

This project is wrapping the QRCoder .Net Wrapper in a .Net dll.
# As such it requires .Net 4.6 to be installed on any computer using the wrapper.


## Current working code within class wrapper.

CreateQRContact - For creating a QR VCard based on contact details image.

CreateQRSkypeCall - For creating a QR Skype Call image.

CreateQRSms - For creating a QR SMS image

CreateQRText - For embeding plain text into a QR image

## Todo

Other methods will be added to wrap bookmarks, calendar, email, geolocation, mms, one time passwords, phone numbers, whatsapp and wifi.
