# QRGenerator (provided by Mark Goldberg)

Looks like I just clarionized the calls. In other words, converted the STRING to CSTRING and use a PRAGMA to link in the the QRGenerator.lib.

The real work is being done by QRGenerator.dll which is SV's (apparently written by Diego), or maybe it just Diego's work, and not SVs. -- not sure.

There's no version resource in the .DLL (or .lib).

Diego is on skype and last I checked speaks spanish so it might be interesting to ask him, or even invite him to one of the clarionero groups.
